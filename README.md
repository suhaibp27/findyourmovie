# Find Your Movie

## Overview

This is a responsive React application created using Vite that fetches data from the TMDB API to display movies and TV series. It utilizes React Router for navigation between different pages, React Icons for rendering icons, and Swiper.js for implementing image carousels in the hero section. The application is designed to work seamlessly across various devices, including mobile phones, laptops, and tablets. The landing page features tabs for trending movies and series, movies, series, and a search feature. Pagination is implemented to display a limited number of items at a time, with the option to load more. Clicking on a movie or TV series opens a modal with more information about the selected item.
